        <h1> Lost </h1>

        <p> You decide to take advantage of the second chance you've been given. </p>
        <p> You find love and eventually start a family. </p>
        <p> However, you never seem to age as time moves on.  </p>
        <p> You go on to outlive your family, whose deaths take a heavy toll on you. </p>
        <p> Everything around you changes as the years pass, but one thing remains constant: you. </p>
        <p> As you continue to outlive everyone, you can't help but feel lost in life as a result of your immortality. </p>
