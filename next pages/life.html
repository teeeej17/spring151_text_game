        <h1> Live </h1>

        <p> You choose to live. </p>
        <p> "Very well," the man says.  "You will live." </p>
        <p> You close your eyes, and as you open them, the man vanishes as mysteriously as he appeared. </p>
        <p> Confused, you start feeling tired and eventually fall asleep.  </p>
        <p> You awaken the next day to the amazement of your doctor.  Somehow, you survived the night.  Not only that, but you are no longer sick as well. </p>
