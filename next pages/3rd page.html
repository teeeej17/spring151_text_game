        <h1> A Strange Man with an Offer </h1>

        <p> You open your eyes to a strange man in your room. </p>
        <p> "Who are you?," you ask. </p>
        <p> "Who I am doesn't matter," he says.  "What matters is my offer to you." </p>
        <p> "I'm dying.  What more could you possibly have to offer?" </p>
        <p> "Life." </p>
        <p> "Life?" </p>
        <p> "You don't have to die tonight.  You can live, but it comes with a price." </p>
        <p> There is nothing but silence as you contemplate. </p>
        <p> "Do you want to live?," the man asks. </p>
        <a href="life.html"> "I want to live." </a>
        <p> or </p>
        <a href="death.html"> "I don't know yet." </a>
