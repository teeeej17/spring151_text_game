        <h1> Found </h1>

        <p> "I have an answer," you tell the man. </p>
        <p> The strange man looks at you with a stern look on his face. </p>
        <p> "No." </p>
        <p> The man takes a breath.  "Are you sure?" he asks. </p>
        <p> "Yes." </p>
        <p> "Very well," the man says before vanishing as mysteriously as he appeared. </p>
        <p> Having found inner peace, you can't help but feel content with your decision. </p>
        <p> You start feeling tired and fall asleep peacefully. </p>
