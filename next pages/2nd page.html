        <h1> The Diagnosis </h1>

        <p> You're in the hospital dying of a terminal illness. </p>
        <p> This has happened before, but it feels different this time.</p>
        <p> Soon, the doctor walks into your room with a grim look on her face. </p>
        <p> "This isn't good," you think to yourself. </p>
        <p> Before she can speak, you interrupt her. </p>
        <p> "How long, Doctor?" </p>
        <p> She shakes her head.  "To put it nicely?  Not long." </p>
        <p> "Doc... How long?" </p>
        <p> She sighs.  "You'd be lucky to make it through the night..." </p>
        <p> There's nothing but silence between you two. </p>
        <p> "I-I'm very sorry.," she says before leaving the room. </p>
        <p><i> Sigh </i></p>
