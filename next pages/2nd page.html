        <h1> The Plot </h1>

        <p> You're in the hospital dying of a terminal illness.  This has happened before, but it feels different this time. </p>
        <p> Soon, the doctor walks into your room with a grim face. </p>
        <p> "This isn't good," you think to yourself. </p>
        <p> Before she can speak, you interrupt her. </p>
        <p> "How long, Doctor?" </p>
        <p> </p>
